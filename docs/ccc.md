# CCC

> The Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) is a fun challenge for students with an interest in programming. Designed to be both accessible to students with some programming experience and to challenge the keenest programmers at the secondary-school level, the CCC helps students build confidence and grow their ability to design, understand and implement algorithms.

See more from [official site](https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/ccc-cco.html). Let's give it a try

## J1

With what we have learned so far, we should be able to solve most J1 and J2 problems.

For example, let's take a look at J1 from [2020's contest](https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/past_ccc_contests/2020/ccc/juniorEF.pdf).

??? info "Sample Solution for 2020-J1"

    ```cpp title="2020-J1" linenums="1"
    --8<-- "ccc/2020/j1.cpp"
    ```

Similarly, J1 from [2021](https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/past_ccc_contests/2021/ccc/juniorEF.pdf) and [2022](https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/past_ccc_contests/2022/ccc/juniorEF.pdf) are both straightforward translation of formula. The key is to understand the problem statement.

??? info "Sample Solution for 2021-J1"

    ```cpp title="2021-J1" linenums="1"
    --8<-- "ccc/2021/j1.cpp"
    ```

??? info "Sample Solution for 2022-J1"

    ```cpp title="2022-J1" linenums="1"
    --8<-- "ccc/2022/j1.cpp"
    ```

## J2

J2 is usually a bit more complex than J1. It's likely that you may at least use some forms of loops.

For example, let's take a look at J2 from [2022's contest](https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/past_ccc_contests/2022/ccc/juniorEF.pdf).

??? info "Sample Solution for 2022-J2"

    ```cpp title="2022-J2" linenums="1"
    --8<-- "ccc/2022/j2.cpp"
    ```

## More Exercise

All the past contests can be found [online](https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html#ccc). We can also use [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/) to evaluate the solutions online.

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) are also good resources if you want to practice coding and problem solving skills.
